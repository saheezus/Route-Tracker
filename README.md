# Route Tracker

A simple app that allows you to type a start and ending location and calculate the fastest route between those locations. Displays the distance and duration of travel on a satellite view and stores routes in a database with unique color codes. Different routes can be displayed simultaneously on the same page, each differentiated by color.
